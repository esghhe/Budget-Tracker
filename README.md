# Budget-Tracker

The Budget-Tracker application allows a user to track their budget when they make withdrawals and deposits. This application will allow you to log in your expense with or without internet connection to help keep your balance accurate. If internet connection is not available, the user can still input expenses or deposits. Once the internet connection reestablishes, the deposits or expenses that were inputted during offline will be added and the total will be updated. When either the deposits or expenses are inputted, the user will be notified. The user will also receive notification that the offline data has been added because the network has been established. Give Spending Wisely a try so you can be more cautious about your spending.
